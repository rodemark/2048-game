# 2048 Game Rules

2048 is a popular puzzle game where the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

## Rules:

1. Use arrow keys to move the tiles in the desired direction (up, down, left, or right).
2. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values.
3. After each move, a new tile randomly appears on the grid with a value of either 2 or 4.
4. The game ends when the player reaches a tile with the number 2048 or when there are no more possible moves (i.e., the grid is full, and no adjacent tiles have the same value).

## Objective:

The goal of the game is to create a tile with the number 2048 by strategically combining tiles and reaching higher numbers.

## Scoring:

The player's score is determined by the value of the tiles they merge. The higher the value of the merged tiles, the higher the score.
